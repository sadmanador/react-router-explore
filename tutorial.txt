1. install react-router-dom =   npm i react-router-dom
2. App.js = const router = createBrowserRouter([])
3. RouterProvider component and pass router props
4. make some route
    4-1.the route would be array of objects.
    4-2. route take path: & element: as object property value.
    4-3. element can react-components.

now the SPA can be browse through path, but url written path is no ideal, therefore, a navbar is made with path in them
1. Header component is made.
2. instead of anchor tag, <Link to'/ '></Link> is written.

two benefit of Link component.
1. Link is build-in component of router.
2. a tag refreshes the page, Link doesn't.

However, Header component is needed to be used in every route initially.

module 52-3
1. For common navigation-bar, a layout component is made in src(out of components)
2. Header component is called in layout.
3. afterwards, <Outlet> build-in component of react is called.
4. the things which will be changed by router will be inside outlet.

4-1. Main component is called from the default path-element.
4.2. default array object can have a third property called children.
4-3. children takes array of object as route path.
 now Header component can be removed from components.

 only those that are not in children route, require individual Header component.
