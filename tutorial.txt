1. install react-router-dom =   npm i react-router-dom
2. App.js = const router = createBrowserRouter([])
3. RouterProvider component and pass router props
4. make some route
    4-1.the route would be array of objects.
    4-2. route take path: & element: as object property value.
    4-3. element can react-components.

now the SPA can be browse through path, but url written path is no ideal, therefore, a navbar is made with path in them
1. Header component is made.
2. instead of anchor tag, <Link to'/ '></Link> is written.

two benefit of Link component.
1. Link is build-in component of router.
2. a tag refreshes the page, Link doesn't.

However, Header component is needed to be used in every route initially.
